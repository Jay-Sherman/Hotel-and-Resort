                <h1>Our Founder</h1>
                <p>
                    Our founder’s journey began in Jamaica, where he was inspired by the island's vibrant culture and natural beauty. After migrating to the U.S., he worked tirelessly to build a new life while never forgetting his dream of returning to Jamaica. With a vision to share his homeland’s wonders with the world, he saved, learned the hospitality industry, and built the connections necessary to bring his dream to life.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Upon returning to Jamaica, he selected a location that perfectly captured the island’s charm—where turquoise waters meet golden sands and lush greenery. He created a resort not only to showcase the island’s beauty but to provide jobs for the local community and offer an authentic Jamaican experience.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Today, the hotel stands as a tribute to his dedication, bringing the soul of Jamaica to life for visitors from around the world. It’s a place where every corner reflects the founder’s dream, blending tradition with luxury and community.
